Hi! My name is Rose. I am a PhD-trained healthcare analyst with a passion for writing about science and medicine. I love transforming complex concepts into clear and compelling narratives.

In 2017, I completed my doctoral degree in Biological Sciences in Public Health at Harvard University. My research explored the effects of age on immune system responses during sepsis. This work has since been published in two peer-reviewed journals.

When I wasn’t at the bench, I spent my free time teaching and developing new science curricula as part of Harvard’s Science Education and Academic Leadership certificate program. It was rewarding to dream up creative ways to teach challenging concepts and guide students through the newly designed lessons. Through my experiences with curriculum development, I developed a passion for decoding science through writing.

To grow as a writer and gain industry experience, I began my career as a Healthcare Analyst at GlobalData. In this role, I have authored multiple deep-dive market analysis reports exploring pharmaceutical trends in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, and myelodysplastic syndromes.

For each report, I survey physicians on their most frequently prescribed therapies and interview key opinion leaders about new developments in the field. I combine these primary data with findings from journal articles, regulatory filings, and other documents to create a detailed report that forecasts market trends over the next decade.

Along with long-form reports, I’ve produced numerous short communications at GlobalData including press releases, insight pieces, conference coverage, and expert commentary. Although my focus is on immunological diseases, I’ve enjoyed branching out into new topics like cybersecurity in healthcare and the medical device market.

My experiences as a doctoral student, teacher, and healthcare analyst have expanded my abilities as a writer and deepened my interest in science communication. I am excited to push further into this field and continue to grow as a writer, communicator, and scientist.
